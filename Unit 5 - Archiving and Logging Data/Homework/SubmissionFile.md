### Step 1: Create, Extract, Compress, and Manage tar Backup Archives

1. Command to **extract** the `TarDocs.tar` archive to the current directory: 

`tar -xf TarDocs.tar` 

2. Command to **create** the `Javaless_Doc.tar` archive from the `TarDocs/` directory, while excluding the `TarDocs/Documents/Java` directory: 

`tar cvf Javaless_Docs.tar --exclude="TarDocs/Documents/Java" TarDocs`

3. Command to ensure `Java/` is not in the new `Javaless_Docs.tar` archive: 

`tar -tvf Javaless_Docs.tar | grep Java`

**Bonus** 
- Command to create an incremental archive called `logs_backup_tar.gz` with only changed files to `snapshot.file` for the `/var/log` directory:

`sudo tar cvzf logs_backup.tar.gz --listed-incremental=snapshot.file --level=0 /var/log`

#### Critical Analysis Question

- Why wouldn't you use the options `-x` and `-c` at the same time with `tar`?

You wouldn't use `-x` and `-c` at the same time with `tar` because they are opposite or contradictory commands, the `-c` option used with `tar` is for creating a new archive while the `-x` option is for extracting files from an existing archive.

### Step 2: Create, Manage, and Automate Cron Jobs

1. Cron job for backing up the `/var/log/auth.log` file: 

`crontab -e`
`0 6 * * 3 tar czf auth_backup.tgz -P /var/log/auth.log`

---

### Step 3: Write Basic Bash Scripts

1. Brace expansion command to create the four subdirectories: 

`mkdir -p ~/backups/{freemem,diskuse,openlist,freedisk}`

2. Paste your `system.sh` script edits below:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    
    #Free memory logged to free_mem.txt
    
    free -h > ~/backups/freemem/free_mem.txt
    
    #Simple output free memory logged to free_mem_simple.txt

    #free -h | awk '{print $1, $4}' | sed s/total/free/ | sed s/shared/memory/ > ~/backups/freemem/free_mem_simple.txt

    #Disk usage logged to disk_usage.txt

    du -h > ~/backups/diskuse/disk_usage.txt

    #Open files logged to open_list.txt

    lsof > ~/backups/openlist/open_list.txt

    #File system disk space statistics logged to free_disk.txt

    df -h > ~/backups/freedisk/free_disk.txt

    #Simple file system disk space statistics logged to free_disk_simple.txt

    #df -h | awk '{print $1, $2, $3, $5}' | column -t > ~/backups/freedisk/free_disk_simple.txt

    ```

3. Command to make the `system.sh` script executable:

`chmod +x system.sh`

**Optional**
- Commands to test the script and confirm its execution:

`sudo ./system.sh`
`cat ~/backups/freemem/free_mem.txt ~/backups/diskuse/disk_usage.txt ~/backups/openlist/open_list.txt ~/backups/freedisk/free_disk.txt`

**Bonus**
- Command to copy `system` to system-wide cron directory:

`sudo cp system.sh /etc/cron.weekly`

---

### Step 4. Manage Log File Sizes
 
1. Run `sudo nano /etc/logrotate.conf` to edit the `logrotate` configuration file. 

    Configure a log rotation scheme that backs up authentication messages to the `/var/log/auth.log`.

    - Add your config file edits below:

    ```bash
    /var/log/auth.log {
        weekly
        rotate 7
        notifempty
        compress
        delaycompress
        missingok
        endscript
    }
    ```

### Bonus: Check for Policy and File Violations

1. Command to verify `auditd` is active:

    `systemctl status auditd`

2. Command to set number of retained logs and maximum log file size:

    - Add the edits made to the configuration file below:

    ```bash
    num_logs = 7
    max_log_file = 35
    ```

3. Command using `auditd` to set rules for `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/passwd` and `/var/log/auth.log`:


    - Add the edits made to the `rules` file below:

    ```bash
    -w /etc/shadow -p wra -k hashpass_audit
    -w /etc/passwd -p wra -k userpass_audit
    -w /var/log/auth.log -p wra -k authlog_audit
    ```

4. Command to restart `auditd`:

`sudo systemctl restart auditd`

5. Command to list all `auditd` rules:

`sudo auditctl -l`

6. Command to produce an audit report:

`sudo aureport -au`

7. Create a user with `sudo useradd attacker` and produce an audit report that lists account modifications:

`sudo aureport -m`

8. Command to use `auditd` to watch `/var/log/cron`:

`sudo auditctl -w /var/log/cron`

9. Command to verify `auditd` rules:

`sudo auditctl -l`

### Bonus (Research Activity): Perform Various Log Filtering Techniques

1. Command to return `journalctl` messages with priorities from emergency to error:

`sudo journalctl -b -p emerg..err`
or
`sudo journalctl -b -p 0..3`

1. Command to check the disk usage of the system journal unit since the most recent boot:

`sudo journalctl -b -u systemd-journald -x | less`

2. Comand to remove all archived journal files except the most recent two:

`sudo journalctl --vacuum-files=2`

3. Command to filter all log messages with priority levels between zero and two, and save output to `/home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt`:

`sudo journalctl -p 0..2 >> /home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt`
or
`sudo journalctl -p emerg..crit >> /home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt`

1. Command to automate the last command in a daily cronjob. Add the edits made to the crontab file below:

    ```bash
    0 0 * * * sudo journalctl -p 0..2 >> /home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt
    or
    @daily sudo journalctl -p 0..2 >> /home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt
    ```
